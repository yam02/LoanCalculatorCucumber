1.	What other tests would you suggest could be written? You do not need to write them out in detail or code them.
- Verify the estimate by editing the data in fields, with clicking on the Start Over button.
- Calculate the estimate for other fields in Your Details section.

2.	If this test was part of a much larger test set, how would you speed it up?
- Use the test as a Background, so that it doesnot need to execute again
- Store the estimated result for further steps if required.

3.	Sometimes UI tests can fail unpredictably. For example, the page may not have fully loaded before test automation
 attempts to click a button on a webpage. How would you improve reliability of these tests?
- Using wait along with Expected Conditions, the explicit wait, before performing the operation.
- Using stable locators like id, name etc.
- Using the API to make calls for the extra steps and verifying only the necessary step in UI.
